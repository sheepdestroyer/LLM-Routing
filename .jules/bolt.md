## 2024-05-20 - [O(1) LRU Eviction using Python Dict Insertion Order]
**Learning:** Python 3.7+ dictionaries maintain insertion order. For caches where hits don't update the timestamp (like our `triage_cache`), the dictionary is naturally ordered from oldest to newest. We can avoid O(N log N) sorting for TTL and LRU evictions by popping elements off the front using `list(dict.keys())[:excess]`.
**Action:** Always consider dictionary insertion order before using `sorted()` or `heapq` for eviction logic in TTL caches without touch-on-read mechanics.
## 2024-05-18 - Parallelize DB model registrations
**Learning:** Sequential HTTP requests during model registration cause N+1 delays and slow down startup/roster sync.
**Action:** Replaced sequential loops with concurrent requests using `asyncio.gather`, improving initialization time significantly.
